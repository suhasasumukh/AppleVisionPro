### My Apple Vision Pro

I wanted to make my own Apple Vision Pro after seeing the original Apple Vision Pro. So, I created a special vision OS that runs the AirSketch program.

You can see how AirSketch works in action by clicking <a href="https://x.com/suhasasumukh/status/1753769807659536404?s=20">here</a>. Inside this repository, you'll find all the program files you need to run AirSketch. As for the hardware, you can build it according to your preferences or you can use this AirSketch program files to run it as a standalone program.

Take a look at the hardware side of my Apple Vision Pro in the image below:
